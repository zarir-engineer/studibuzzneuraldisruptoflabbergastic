Great question. Here's a simple breakdown of the **types of AI**, from basic to advanced, in both **capability** and **functionality**.

---

## 🧠 By Capability (What AI *can* do)

### 1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** ✅ *Exists today*

* Designed for a specific task only
* Can’t generalize beyond its scope
* Examples:

  * Siri, Alexa
  * Google Translate
  * ChatGPT

> 🔹 It's “smart” in one area, but dumb everywhere else.

---

### 2. **General AI (AGI – Artificial General Intelligence)** 🚧 *Still theoretical*

* Performs any intellectual task a human can do
* Learns, reasons, adapts across domains
* Would pass a "real" Turing Test consistently

> 🤖 A true AI “mind” — we’re not there yet.

---

### 3. **Superintelligent AI** 🚫 *Hypothetical/Future*

* Exceeds human intelligence in all respects
* Could reason, solve problems, and innovate faster than humans
* Raises major ethical and existential questions

> 🧨 Think: AI gods. Not real (yet), but explored in philosophy and fiction.

---

## ⚙️ By Function (How AI is built or works)

### 1. **Reactive Machines**

* No memory or learning
* Responds only to current input
* Example: IBM’s Deep Blue (chess)

### 2. **Limited Memory**

* Can use recent past data
* Most current ML systems use this
* Example: ChatGPT, self-driving cars

### 3. **Theory of Mind (future)**

* Would understand emotions, intentions, beliefs
* Needed for human-like empathy and collaboration

### 4. **Self-Aware AI (very speculative)**

* AI that knows it exists
* Would have consciousness

| Category                                 | Examples                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Supervised Learning**               | Spam detection, image labeling      |
| 🧩 **Unsupervised Learning**             | Market segmentation, topic modeling |
| 🎰 **Reinforcement Learning**            | Robotics, game AI (AlphaGo)         |
| 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Chatbots, translators               |
| 🖼️ **Computer Vision**                  | Face recognition, object detection  |
