This Markdown file is built for exploration, not pressure. Let me know if you'd like me to:
- âœ… Start building your first **visual learning map**
- âœ… Turn this into a **Notion-style dashboard**
- âœ… Or expand it into a full **interactive course format**

You can go at your own pace, loop back anytime, and never worry about "falling behind."

You're not behind â€” you're building differently. That counts.
