# 🤖 Infusing AI into Algomin (Algo Trading Tool)

**Yes, you can absolutely infuse AI into Algomin** — and this is one of the best, most purpose-driven ways to learn and apply AI/ML in your own workflow.

## 🔥 ADHD-Friendly Ways to Add AI to Algomin

Each of these is a mini-project with real utility, a great learning curve, and expandable into a full product.

---

### 1. 🧠 Natural Language to Strategy

> **Input:** “If RSI is below 30 and MACD is turning up, go long”

AI converts this to a structured `conditionBlock`.

- **Tech**: LLM (GPT-4, Claude, or open-source models)
- **How**: Prompt → parse → generate internal DSL or JSON → feed to conditionGroups.ts
- **Learnings**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), prompt engineering, JSON structuring

---

### 2. 🧩 AI-Suggested Strategy Blocks

> **Input:** Partial strategy  
> **AI Suggests:** “Add a trailing SL after MACD crosses up.”

- **Tech**: OpenAI Assistant API, or local embedding search (`faiss`)
- **How**: Match current blocks with known patterns and suggest additions
- **Learnings**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), embeddings, fine-tuning logic

---

### 3. 📈 Backtest Result Summarizer

> **Input:** P&L and metrics  
> **AI Says:** “Biggest loss happened in sideways markets. Add volatility filter?”

- **Tech**: GPT or LLMs with backtest logs
- **How**: Parse logs → feed summary to GPT → display insights
- **Learnings**: Text summarization, LLM grounding, context length optimization

---

### 4. 🔍 Pattern Detection on OHLCV Data

> Detect: Double tops, flags, RSI divergences

- **Tech**: CNN, Transformer-based models, or libraries like `btgym`, `FinRL`
- **How**: Train models on labeled chart patterns or use unsupervised detection
- **Learnings**: Feature extraction, supervised learning, visual pattern tagging

---

### 5. ⚙️ Auto-Tuning of Parameters

> Instead of setting RSI = 14 manually, AI finds optimal value

- **Tech**: Grid search, Genetic Algorithms, Bayesian Optimization
- **How**: Run backtests with parameter sweeps → select best based on PnL
- **Learnings**: Optimization techniques, performance evaluation

---

### 6. 🧘 Emotion Tagging / Risk Psychology Assistant

> **Example:** "You exit early after 2 losses. Want to add a cooldown rule?"

- **Tech**: Log analysis + AI prompt feedback
- **How**: Parse trade history → detect behavior → suggest psychology tweaks
- **Learnings**: Trading psychology + data analysis + pattern recognition

## 🧪 Start Small: First Mini-Project Suggestion

### ✅ **#1: Natural Language → Strategy Block Translator**

**Why this?**
- Hooks directly into your existing `Choose → Context UI → Preview` flow
- No deep ML needed to start — you learn by building around AI

#### First Milestone:
- Prompt: `"Buy when RSI is under 30"`
- Output: Parsed JSON for condition block
- Integration: Plug into your `ChooseBlock.tsx` and show in `Preview`

---

## 🧰 What You'll Learn by Doing This

- Prompt design for trading DSLs
- Translating language to schema
- Calling APIs (OpenAI, local models)
- UI+backend glue to connect AI to UX
- Making AI assistive, not controlling

---

## ✅ You Don’t Need:
- No academic ML theory
- No courses
- No full model training (yet)
- No guilt about not following traditional paths

---
