# AI Learning Path for Image Processing & VFX

This markdown is a complete roadmap for anyone who wants to dive into AI, with a special focus on image processing and the VFX industry. It's structured in 5 parts, from foundational learning to working in the industryâ€”and finally, taking that epic road trip.

---

## Part 1: Learn AI Generally (Foundations)

### Goals

* Understand AI and machine learning fundamentals.
* Gain confidence with core tools and concepts.

### Key Topics

* **Python programming**
* **Linear algebra, calculus, probability** (for ML understanding)
* **Machine learning** (supervised, unsupervised)
* **Deep learning** (neural networks, CNNs)

### Tools & Libraries

* Python, NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib
* scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras

### Courses

* [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai)
* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
* [CS50 AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/)

## Part 2: Build Portfolio-Ready Projects (Showcase on Blog)

### Goals

* Apply your learning to visual and creative projects.
* Build a blog/portfolio with clear before-after examples.

### Projects Ideas

* **Image classifier** (e.g. animals, products)
* **Face detection** using OpenCV
* **Image stylization** using GANs or Neural Style Transfer
* **Text-to-image generation** using Stable Diffusion
* **Video rotoscoping** with SAM (Segment Anything Model)

### Tools

* OpenCV, Pillow, matplotlib
* PyTorch or TensorFlow
* Hugging Face Models
* Runway ML or ComfyUI (no-code/low-code AI workflows)

### Output

* Blog with walkthroughs
* Before/After visuals
* GitHub repo links

## Part 3: Get Industry-Ready (VFX Career Path)

### Goals

* Integrate AI with common VFX tools.
* Learn the software pipelines and how AI fits in.

### Key Tools

* **Blender** â€“ 3D and compositing (Python scripting)
* **Unreal Engine** â€“ Real-time rendering + Blueprints + Python
* **Nuke / After Effects** â€“ Compositing; AI-assisted plugins

### Advanced AI Tools

* **ControlNet + Stable Diffusion** â€“ For asset and texture generation
* **DINO, CLIP** â€“ Feature extraction, understanding image semantics
* **RIFE** â€“ AI-based video frame interpolation

### Projects

* AI-generated assets integrated into Blender scenes
* Use ControlNet to generate VFX-style effects (e.g. smoke, debris)
* Use SAM + OpenCV for clean green screen-style cutouts

### Outcome

* Showreel with AI-assisted shots
* Python scripts or plugin demos
* Publish case studies ("How I used ControlNet to generate motion graphics")

---

## Part 4: Continuous Learning & Development

### Keep Evolving

* Follow updates on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)
* Subscribe to newsletters (Import AI, The Batch)
* Join Discord communities (like Runway, ComfyUI, or Stable Diffusion groups)
* Contribute to open-source projects (e.g. COLMAP, AnimateDiff)

### Continuous Projects

* Fine-tune existing models
* Build plugins for VFX tools
* Explore real-time AI workflows (e.g. using AI inside Unreal Engine)

---

## Part 5: Take a Holiday to America and Drive the Longest Road

### Just Do It ðŸ˜Ž

* You've earned it.
* AI doesnâ€™t stop, but you should take a break.
* Drive Route 20 from Boston, MA to Newport, OR.

---

## âœ… Starter Dev Environment

### Local Setup

* Python (via Anaconda or pyenv)
* VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
* Git + GitHub
* Conda virtual environments

### Cloud GPU Options

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
* [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io), [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com)

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World: AI for Image Processing

```python
import cv2

# Load image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Canny Edge Detection
edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 100, 200)

# Save result
cv2.imwrite('edges.jpg', edges)
```

This is the simplest example of using AI-style logic (edge detection) on an image. From here, you can explore segmentation, object detection, or generative models.
