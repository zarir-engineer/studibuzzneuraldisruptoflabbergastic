# 🧠 Step-by-Step: Natural Language → Strategy Block (for Algomin)

This guide helps you build an AI-powered feature in **Algomin** that lets users describe a strategy in natural language — and converts it into a structured JSON block for the UI.

---

## 🧱 Project Overview

**Goal**: Let users type something like:

> “If RSI is below 30 and MACD is turning up, buy.”

And auto-generate a condition block compatible with your existing Algomin UI flow (Choose → Context UI → Preview).

---

## 🧰 Stack Suggestions

- **Frontend**: React (your current Algomin setup)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python FastAPI (for calling AI)
- **AI API**: OpenAI GPT-4 (can later swap with local LLM)
- **Schema**: Your internal JSON block from `conditionGroups.ts`

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Define the Target Output JSON

Use a sample from your `conditionGroups.ts`.

```json
{
  "id": "block-123",
  "type": "condition",
  "operator": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "left": "RSI",
      "operator": "<",
      "right": "30"
    },
    {
      "left": "MACD",
      "operator": "crossesAbove",
      "right": "Signal"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 2: Prompt Engineering

Use a system prompt like:

> "Convert the user's natural language strategy into this JSON format..."

And user prompt:

> “If RSI is below 30 and MACD crosses up, buy.”

Use GPT-4 via OpenAI's API (or Assistant API).

---

### Step 3: Build the Backend

Create a simple API:

- **POST /generate-strategy**
- Input: { "text": "If RSI < 30 and MACD turns up, buy" }
- Output: JSON condition block

Use Python FastAPI or Node.js Express. (I can scaffold this.)

---

### Step 4: Plug Into Algomin Frontend

In `ChooseBlock.tsx`:

- Add a “🪄 Convert Natural Language” option
- Capture user input
- Call backend `/generate-strategy`
- Inject returned JSON into `contextUI` and `previewBlock`

---

### Step 5: Handle Errors / Feedback

- If AI output is invalid, show message
- Allow user to **edit final JSON** manually (optional)
- Log user input/output for later improvements

---

### Step 6: Optional Enhancements

- Let AI **suggest improvements**: “Would you like to add a stoploss?”
- Show LLM explanation: “Here’s how I interpreted your input...”
- Add memory of recent strategies via localStorage or backend DB

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

This one feature:
- Makes Algomin 10x more user-friendly
- Gives you an excuse to integrate LLMs cleanly
- Helps you learn NLP, APIs, and prompt-tuning by doing
